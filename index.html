            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Chandrayaan-3</b> is the third and most recent lunar Indian Space Research exploration mission under the Chandrayaan programme. It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter. Its propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite. The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.
                Following Chandrayaan-2, where a last-minute glitch in the landing guidance software led to the lander crashing after entering lunar orbit, another lunar mission was proposed.
                The launch of Chandrayaan-3 took place on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST and lunar injection of 100 km circular polar orbit was completed successfully as part of phase one.The lander and rover are expected to land near the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023.
                The Chandrayaan-3 mission is a stepping stone towards ISRO’s future interplanetary missions. The key idea is technology demonstration of crucial capability to soft land on lunar surface safely that the earlier mission could not achieve.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                ISRO has set three main objectives for the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which include:
            <ul>
                <li> Getting a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the Moon.</li>
                <li> Observing and demonstrating the rover’s loitering capabilities on the Moon.</li>
                <li> In-site observation & conducting experiments on the materials available on the lunar surface to better understand composition of the Moon.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
         </section>
         <section class="Launch_section">
            <h2>Launch</h2>
            <p>
                Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST as scheduled, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India. The spacecraft has been effectively placed in the trajectory it will take to reach the moon. It is anticipated that the Chandrayaan-3 mission will achieve a soft landing on the lunar South Pole region on 23 August.
                Choosing the month of July for the launch of Chandrayaan 3 was a special move because of a calculation made by ISRO regarding the closeness of Earth and Moon.

            <h2>Funding</h2>
                <p>
                    In December 2019, it was reported that ISRO requested the initial funding of the project, amounting to ₹75 crore (US$9.4 million), out of which ₹60 crore (US$7.5 million) will be for meeting expenditure towards machinery, equipment and other capital expenditure, while the remaining ₹15 crore (US$1.9 million) is sought under revenue expenditure head.
                    Confirming the existence of the project, ISRO's former chairman K. Sivan stated that the estimated cost would be around ₹615 crore (equivalent to ₹721 crore or US$90 million in 2023).
